# Restaline - SVG fills for pen plotters

# Bugs

- missing edges on rocket
- Unioning flipping fill on fish
- duplicated edge lines... take top(can't do for complex paths) or inset all closed paths?

# TODO

- avoid filling unfilled paths
- surface progress somehow
- fill using fixed angle
- Split up final paths into groups

## Development

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

## Tests

When running locally [http://local.host:8000/tests]
